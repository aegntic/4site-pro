## VIRAL MECHANICS SPECIFICATIONS

### Viral Score Algorithm
```sql
-- Mathematical precision with weighted factors
v_final_score := (
  engagement_base * share_multiplier * time_decay * 
  tier_bonus * quality_score
)

-- Share multiplier progression
1.0x → 1.2x → 1.5x → 2.0x → 3.0x (based on external shares)

-- Time decay for content freshness
max(0.8, 1.0 - (days_old / 30))

-- Subscription tier bonuses
Business: 1.3x, Enterprise: 1.1x
```

### Commission System Economics
```
Year 1-2:  20% commission rate
Year 3-4:  25% commission rate  
Year 5+:   40% commission rate

Expected Customer Lifetime: 4.2 years
Average Revenue Per User: $348/year
Commission Value: $1,464 lifetime per referral
```

### Free Pro Milestone
```
Threshold: 10 successful referrals
Reward: 12 months of Pro tier
Value: $348 ($29/month × 12)
Expected Conversion: 15-25% of active users
```
