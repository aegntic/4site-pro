## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19** with concurrent features
- **Vite** for blazing fast development
- **TailwindCSS** with custom configuration
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Glass morphism** design system

### Backend Services
- **FastAPI** for high-performance APIs
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching and sessions
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

### AI Integration
- **Google Gemini** for content analysis
- **FLUX.1** for image generation
- **DeepSeek R1.1** for code understanding
- **Custom orchestration** for multi-model coordination

## üí° Design Philosophy

### User Experience Principles
1. **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately after installation
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work everywhere, advanced features enhance experience
3. **Accessibility First**: WCAG AAA compliance target
4. **Performance Obsessed**: <3s load time on 3G networks

### Visual Design Language
- **Glass Morphism**: Modern, sophisticated aesthetic
- **Dark Mode First**: Reduces eye strain, looks professional
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle feedback for all interactions
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes
