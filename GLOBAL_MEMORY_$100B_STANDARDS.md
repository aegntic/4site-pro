- **CUSTOMER SUCCESS**: Onboarding flows, success milestones

### VIRAL MECHANICS EXCELLENCE CRITERIA

#### Enhanced Viral Score Algorithm
```sql
-- STANDARD: Mathematical precision with multiple weighted factors
v_final_score := (
  engagement_base * share_multiplier * time_decay * 
  tier_bonus * quality_score * network_effect
)
```

#### Commission System Integrity
```sql
-- STANDARD: Accurate lifetime tracking with escalating rewards
20% → 25% → 40% with bulletproof audit trails
```

#### Free Pro Milestone System
```sql
-- STANDARD: Automated qualification with immediate benefits
10 conversions = instant Pro upgrade + showcase eligibility
```
