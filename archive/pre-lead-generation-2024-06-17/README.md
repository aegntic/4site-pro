# Archive: Pre-Lead Generation Planning Documents

**Archive Date:** June 17, 2024  
**Reason:** Strategic pivot to distributed lead generation network

## Contents

This archive contains the original planning documents before the strategic transformation to a lead generation network:

- `TASKS.md` - Original task tracking (258 tasks, appeared 31% complete)
- `PLANNING.md` - Original project planning documents
- Additional planning files from subdirectories

## Context

These documents were archived after discovering they tracked aspirational Phase 2/3 enterprise features rather than MVP completion. The actual MVP was 85-90% complete, not 31% as initially assessed.

The strategic pivot introduced:
1. Universal lead capture on every generated site
2. aegntic-first social platform verification
3. GitHub-native workflow with automatic forking
4. Viral growth mechanics and rich metadata collection

## New Planning Documents

See the root directory for current planning:
- `MVP_LEAD_GENERATION_PLAN.md` - Current approved implementation plan
- `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL_2024-06-17.md` - Daily development tracking

## Historical Value

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding the original enterprise vision
- Feature roadmap for post-MVP development
- Context for architectural decisions
- Progress tracking methodology

The enterprise features tracked in these documents will be implemented in the ULTRAPLAN phase (months 2-12) after MVP completion.
